## Claiming
All of our servers use the latest Grief Prevention plugin for claiming.

### How to Claim
To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, [2D or 3D](#2D-vs-3D). Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.

### 2D vs 3D
2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.

### How to Subdivide Claims
Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command ``subdivideclaims``. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.
