### Adding a Modpack
When you launch into FTB App you will be greeted with a simple interface that will show you featured Modpacks. This interface will likely look somewhat familiar if you've used the CurseForge beta launcher as they are similiar.

There's a few options to install modpacks with the simplest being to search directly for the pack.

1. Click the search icon on the left hand side of the window.

2. This will take you to a new window that looks like the following. Please type the name of the modpack you're looking to install in the search bar at the top. We'll use OceanBlock in this example.

3. Click the green download icon on the right hand side of the modpack search results.

4. While referring to the pack version that we are currently using, look for it in the drop down list. You might need to check "Show Beta and Alpha versions" to find it. Click Install to install.

5. Once the modpack has finished installing you should now see a clickable green "View Instance" button in the bottom left. You will need to click it to be brought to the modpack screen.

### Updating Modpacks
Time to time pack authors will release updates to packs and prompt us to update our servers as a result. When this happens you will also need to update your pack version to be able to connect. Luckily with FTB App this is simple to do.

1. Make sure you're on this page and then click "Versions"

2. Click on the version you would like to install, for example 1.3.0 then click the orange update button.

3. The modpack will now be preforming an update that looks / behaves very much like an install would normally. Once this process is done you'll have a green "View Instance"  button to click and then you're able to play the updated pack.

### Backup Modpacks with FTB App

At the time of writing there's currently no way to backup modpacks on this launcher through the app.
