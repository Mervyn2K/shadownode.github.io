## About GDLauncher

GDLauncher is a Minecraft launcher. It can be used to launch vanilla Minecraft, custom modpacks, or regular modpacks. This launcher is one of our recommended options for installing modpacks and managing mods. GDLauncher works on all major platforms - Windows, Linux and macOS.

### How to Install
1. Head to [GDevs](https://gdevs.io) and select which software is most appropriate for you. Typically you want to click the "Download Now!" button.
2. Click the download link related to your OS and then save it to your Downloads folder for easy access.
3. Click the downloaded installer link and it will prompt you to install Java 8 and Java 16. This should be done automatically by the launcher with no intervention needed on your part. 
4. Next it should ask you to login to your Minecraft or Microsoft account. Please do so now.
5. After this process is done you should be greeted by a mostly blank window telling you no instance has been installed. See below for more details on adding mod packs.


### Adding a Modpack
1. Click the + button in GDLaunchers Main Window.

### Backup Modpacks with GDLauncher
If you're wanting to modify the mods in your pack it's highly recommend you backup your instance first. This prevents you from having to do a completely clean reinstall.

1. Right click on your modpack and select "Duplicate"
