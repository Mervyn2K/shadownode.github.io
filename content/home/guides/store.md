### Overview
When you first open the [website](https://shop.shadownode.ca), it should be quite easy to understand.

- Top Customer 
    - This shows the person who has supported us the most throughout the entire month.
- Recent Payments
    - This is the list of the most recent purchases that went through. If you purchase something, your name should be displayed within 20 minutes after confirming your payment. You should also receive your reward in this time. 

### Categories

- Ranks/Rank Upgrades
    - These two categories are for changing your in-game prefix and giving you a few neat perks. No in-game features are locked or require you to have certain ranks to progress, these perks are all just quality-of-life enhancements like ```/feed```, ``/fly``, ``/back`` or multiple homes. See [rank overview](/server-info/ranks/) for all ranks and their perks.
- Claimblocks
    - Here you can find a few kits of Claimblocks you can buy to extend the amount of space you have to build on the server. You can also get them passively by playing on the server or in the ``/tokenshop``.
- Chunkloaders
    - A chunkloader keeps your base loaded while you are offline! They use a lot of server resources so we have to charge for this feature. See [chunk loaders](/home/guides/chunkloaders) for more detailed information about how to use the chunk loader plugin.
- Misc. Items
    - Currently we only have the "Pay What You Want" option in here. This item has no reward, so please only use this function if you really want to support us without expecting anything in return.

- Perks
{{% notice note%}}
All of these shop perks have commands that must be run on a 1.12 client to use. We recommend joining our lobby server at `play.shadownode.ca` with a 1.12 Vanilla install to use them.
