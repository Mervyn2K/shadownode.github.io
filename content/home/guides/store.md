### Overview

### Categories

- Ranks/Rank Upgrades
    - These two categories are for changing your in-game prefix and giving you a few neat perks. No in-game features are locked or require you to have certain ranks to progress, these perks are all just quality-of-life enhancements like ```/feed```, ``/fly``, ``/back`` or multiple homes. See [rank overview](/server-info/ranks/) for all ranks and their perks.
- Claim Blocks
    - Here you can find a few kits of Claimblocks you can buy to extend the amount of space you have to build on the server. You can also get them by buying them in the ``/tokenshop`` as a vote reward.
- ChunkLoaders
    - A chunkloader keeps your base loaded while you are offline! They use a lot of server resources so we have to charge for this feature. See [chunk loaders](/home/guides/chunkloaders) for more detailed information about how to use the chunk loader plugin.
    - Chunkloaders when bought in the larger quanity packs are an area that is able to be loaded. For example the 5 radius option loads an area of 5x5 chunks.
- Misc. Items
    - Currently, we only have the "Pay What You Want" option in here. This item has no reward, so please only use this function if you really want to support us without expecting anything in return.
- Crate Keys
    - Crates are kind of like an in game loot box. They give you a change to win a prize for an item that you may want.
    - To find out what is likely to be in a crate check out [the loot table]().
- Perks

All of these shop perks have commands that must be run on a 1.12 client to use. We recommend joining our lobby server at `play.shadownode.ca` with a 1.12 Vanilla install to use them.
