title: Wipes and Restarts
author: YourMCGeek
-----------------------------

Servers restart every once in a while to reduce lag. This does not mean that a restart will fix all kinds of lag so, please, **do not** as staff to restart a server due to lag. **Restarts are NOT wipes**, they are just a daily reboot to the server. *Ground items are cleared every 20 minutes (XX:10, XX:30, XX:50). There is a 1 minute warning before a clear.*

All times listed are in Eastern Standard Time (EST). This is the same as GMT-5. Wipes will happen during the nightly restart. Restarts happen both in the AM and in the PM.

Compact Machines, Spectre, and the Void dimensions are not wiped. **The overworld and space are only wiped if there are heavy lag issues that the staff team cannot fix.**

{{% notice warning %}}
Any items lost from these  wipes will not get refunded as there are many warnings before the wipe occurs. Overworld wipes will remove everything, and the server will start over fresh.
