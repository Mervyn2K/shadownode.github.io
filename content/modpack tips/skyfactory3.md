## Important Rules

Our Skyfactory 3 server follows all global rules that are appliciable to all of our other servers. You can find our [global rules](/rules) on our wiki and at `/spawn`.

As an improtant note, do not build a 1 chunk bases or farms. ShadowNode staff will take action as required. Staff response will depend on the situation.

## Commands

There's a good number of commands that you should be aware of for using this pack, espcially in group play and you can find them on our commands page under the [Island/Cave](/home/commands/#islandcave-area) section. 

#### Getting Started

If you've never played on ShadowNode's Skyfactory 3 server, the way you get started is to run `/area create`. Make sure you read the rules in spawn first.

#### Trades

Some items are not possible to get via normal means you will need to trade to get them. You can do so by running the `/trade` command. It will open a UI with the possible trades on the server.
