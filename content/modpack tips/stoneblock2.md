## Commands

There's a good number of commands that you should be aware of for using this pack, espcially in group play and you can find them on our commands page under the [Island/Cave](/home/commands/#islandcave-area) section. 

If you've never played on ShadowNode's Stoneblock 2 server, the way you get started is to run `/area create`. Make sure you read the rules in spawn first.

## Suggested Changes

### Disable Craft Presence GUI

Craft Presence is a mod that is designed to allow you to share your currently playing status to Discord, however, it has keybinds and other features that disrupt use of other core features. One core feature it has a conflicting keybind with is the veinminer mod. 

Normally we would suggest rebinding the key for Craft Presence's GUI in the controls setting, however, they have moved it. To disable the keybinding you can follow the steps below to regain access to Ultiminer.

1. Press the grave key  - `` ` ``.  You will get a new GUI window with options pop up when you do so.

2. Click the button labeled "Accessibility Settings" and you should see the following page.

3. At the bottom there's a button labled "Config GUI Keybind" that you need to click. Once you do it will say "None" so you'll simply need to press "ESC" on your keyboard to delete the keybind. Press the back key.
4. You will now be redirected back to the original screen and there will now be a new button in the middle at the bottom that says "Save". Click this and you're able to use FTB Ultimine normally.
