## Why Support Tickets
Support tickets are a great way to ensure that your issue gets properly tracked and handled by the right team. In order to get a support ticket created you will need a few things.

1. Be in ShadowNode's [Discord Server](https://discord.shadownode.ca).
2. Have embeds enabled in Discord (this is on by default).
3. Ability to talk / use our [#tickets channel](https://discord.com/channels/124188711603798016/379180312871043073)

## Creating a ticket
